# Payload CMS Form Builder ‚Äì Frame Tech Backend Evaluation

This project demonstrates a working implementation of a **Payload CMS** deployed to **Vercel** with **Supabase Postgres** as the database provider. It includes a form builder integration using Payload's official plugin and allows submissions through both the admin UI and REST API.
